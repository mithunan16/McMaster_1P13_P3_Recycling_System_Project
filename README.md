# McMaster_1P13_P3_Recycling_System_Project
## McMaster University Engineering 1P13 Project 3 Thurs-03
### Description
This is the code repository for **Engineering 1P13 Project 3: Revenge of the Recycling System**. This code may be used with the associated hardware to operate the Q-Arm and Q-Bot in the *Quanser Interactive Labs Virtual Environment*.
### Navigation
* The [Common](https://github.com/mithunan16/McMaster_1P13_P3_Recycling_System_Project/tree/main/Common) folder is where the common libraries needed to run Q-Labs software can be found
* The [Student_Files](https://github.com/mithunan16/McMaster_1P13_P3_Recycling_System_Project/tree/main/Student_Files) folder is where you can find the code to execute the full system in the virtual environment
### Configuration
To use this code, a Raspberry Pi 4 with system specs for software that fulfills McMaster University's minimal requirements is needed. The [Common](https://github.com/mithunan16/McMaster_1P13_P3_Recycling_System_Project/tree/main/Common) and [Student_Files](https://github.com/mithunan16/McMaster_1P13_P3_Recycling_System_Project/tree/main/Student_Files) folders should be downloaded and imported to the Pi. The Quanser Interactive Labs simulation program must be installed according to McMaster University's criteria. During simulation, the IP address in the code must match the IP address of the computer running the simulation. The code can be executed by running [P3_Code.py](https://github.com/mithunan16/McMaster_1P13_P3_Recycling_System_Project/blob/main/Student_Files/P3_Code.py).
